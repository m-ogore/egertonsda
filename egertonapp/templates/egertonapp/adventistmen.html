		<h1>EGERTON SEVENTH DAY CHURCH ADVENTIST MEN ORGANIZATION (AMO)</h1>
		<h4>
			Egerton Seventh Day Church Adventist Men Organization is a department within the church that is concerned with the nurturing of men for the service to God, family and the community.  Our goal is to meet the spiritual needs of the men in the church through prayer and fellowship. We help men realize their spiritual gifts through bible study and challenge them to understand the need for being great spiritual role models and witnesses for Christ. Specifically, the department has been established to promote programmes and activities designed to foster the spiritual, intellectual, social, moral, health and physical well-being of men and to give them opportunities to understand the responsibilities of Adventist men and to engage them in evangelistic activities.
